15:56:57 §e[NPC] §9Queen Mismyla§f: §r§fThe King made me go grocery shopping. Me! Can you believe that? He has a pair of perfectly good legs, and still, here I am.

15:57:20 §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fI found an unexplored cave while mining for titanium. But it's too dark to see in there, even for me! Can you spare any glowing pumpkins?
15:57:22 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI don't really have a sweet tooth, but chocolate is probably my favorite thing in this world. But the supply is really poor mostly because of the mines' lack of accessibility.
16:01:24 §e[NPC] §aGeonathan Greatforge§f: §r§fI usually only work with Oil Barrels, but I'd like to try making some Biofuel from compost.

16:48:04 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fAmazing! I haven't eaten such chocolatey goodness in a long time...Maybe they should invest in that rusty old lift.
16:48:09 §e[NPC] §aPest Wrangler§f: §r§fThere's pests everywhere. I can smell 'em in the walls!

17:37:08 §e[NPC] §aArthur§f: §r§fMy wheat minion has been slacking recently, I am thinking about giving it an upgrade. He hasn't produced any wheat in years! Every time I check on him, he's empty.
17:37:10 §e[NPC] §aArthur§f: §r§fHoly Macaroni! That should boost my minion to at least Tier 5! Thank you a lot!
