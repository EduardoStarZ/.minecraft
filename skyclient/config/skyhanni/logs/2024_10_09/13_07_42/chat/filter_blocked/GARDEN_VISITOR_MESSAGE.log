13:33:14 §e[NPC] §aPest Wrangler§f: §r§fThere's pests everywhere. I can smell 'em in the walls!
13:33:23 §e[NPC] §aPest Wrangler§f: §r§fThanks mate, this should help me catch 'em!
13:33:27 §e[NPC] §aPlumber Joe§f: §r§fI once dumped a magical water bucket into the toilet. It won't stop overflowing. Anyway, you got something for me?
13:33:29 §e[NPC] §aHornum§f: §r§fBuurrrp!
13:33:33 §e[NPC] §9Queen Mismyla§f: §r§fThe King made me go grocery shopping. Me! Can you believe that? He has a pair of perfectly good legs, and still, here I am.
13:33:36 §e[NPC] §aRyu§f: §r§fDid you know that there is a Garden Level? Increase it by hitting milestones or selling to customers like me!
13:37:03 §e[NPC] §6Pest Wrangler?§f: §r§f§7§oThe figure hands you a slip of paper.
13:37:14 §e[NPC] §6Pest Wrangler?§f: §r§f§7§oThe figure nods at you and shambles away.
13:37:22 §e[NPC] §aPlumber Joe§f: §r§fThanks. That should help me fix my water troubles.
13:46:17 §e[NPC] §aLynn§f: §r§fIf you ever get lost, you should check on the Desk on what to do next.
13:46:20 §e[NPC] §aLynn§f: §r§fHave a good one.
13:46:25 §e[NPC] §9Queen Mismyla§f: §r§fThe King made me go grocery shopping. Me! Can you believe that? He has a pair of perfectly good legs, and still, here I am.
13:46:35 §e[NPC] §9Queen Mismyla§f: §r§fI bet when I am back, they are all still sitting around that table! All day, every day! It's ludicrous!
13:51:05 §e[NPC] §aRyu§f: §r§fDid you know that there is a Garden Level? Increase it by hitting milestones or selling to customers like me!
13:51:07 §e[NPC] §aRyu§f: §r§fGood trade!
13:51:07 §e[NPC] §aHornum§f: §r§fBuurrrp!
13:51:09 §e[NPC] §aHornum§f: §r§fBURP!?!
13:51:10 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fAhoy, §bEduardaStarZ§f! People always tell me they like ice cream, but ice never really tastes like anything for me!
13:51:29 §e[NPC] §9Shifty§f: §r§fIt seems like my brew selection is rather small...I've recently heard that melon juice is really sought after so maybe it can enhance my drinks' flavors!
13:55:34 §e[NPC] §aJamie§f: §r§fYou might have noticed that you can purchase additional plots within your Desk in the Barn!
13:55:37 §e[NPC] §aJamie§f: §r§fThank you! Until next time!
13:55:49 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fYou are saying I need to combine these items with ice to have a taste? I'll believe it when I see it!
13:59:57 §e[NPC] §9Shifty§f: §r§fWell done! I'm sure that even Sirius will enjoy my revolutionary melon refreshments.
13:59:58 §e[NPC] §9Tammy§f: §r§fI've been planning to build a trap for unaware animals so I can hunt them more efficiently. I really need some cactus, preferably the ones with the biggest spikes!
14:04:50 §e[NPC] §aHornum§f: §r§fBuurrrp!
14:04:52 §e[NPC] §9Tammy§f: §r§fI've been planning to build a trap for unaware animals so I can hunt them more efficiently. I really need some cactus, preferably the ones with the biggest spikes!
14:05:47 §e[NPC] §9Tammy§f: §r§fAmazing! Thanks for taking the time! Now, time to finish my Cactus Trap...and hopefully it boosts my pelt earnings.
14:05:54 §e[NPC] §aHornum§f: §r§fBURP!?!
15:32:45 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fI'm planning to head back into the gorge to fetch my hiker friend, but I'll need some meat to cook before I head in there.
15:33:10 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fThanks! I'll be heading to look for him as soon as possible.
15:33:15 §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fExploring the whole wide world makes me hungry, I could take some fresh potatoes.
15:33:17 §e[NPC] §aMason§f: §r§fI paid for one of Treasure Hunter's tips today and again, it only led me to a dirty shoelace. His tips are just not worth it...
15:33:21 §e[NPC] §aRoyal Resident§f: §r§fMy neighbor told me to get off his property, but he doesn't even own this place!
15:34:51 §e[NPC] §aRoyal Resident§f: §rMaybe I have to talk to the King about him. He is going too far. I think the current King is §l§6Redros§f.
