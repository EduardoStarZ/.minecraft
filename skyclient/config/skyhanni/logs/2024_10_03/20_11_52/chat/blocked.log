20:54:15 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fI have a big problem. I lost my sense of taste, now I can't tell the difference between a melon and a cactus...
20:54:18 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aAlchemist§f: §r§fBeen running low on my brewing supplies, Nether Warts are quite hard to come by these days.
20:54:36 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aAlchemist§f: §r§fProject Centurion can finally begin. You've been quite the help.
20:54:37 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI don't really have a sweet tooth, but chocolate is probably my favorite thing in this world. But the supply is really poor mostly because of the mines' lack of accessibility.
20:54:40 [NEW_VISITOR_ARRIVED] §a§r§aJotraeline Greatforge §r§ehas arrived on your §r§aGarden§r§e!
20:54:40 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fI found an unexplored cave while mining for titanium. But it's too dark to see in there, even for me! Can you spare any glowing pumpkins?
20:54:42 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fAhoy, §bEduardaStarZ§f! People always tell me they like ice cream, but ice never really tastes like anything for me!
20:54:47 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aJotraeline Greatforge§f: §r§fI heard you have a composter in your barn, it happens to run on the same fuel drills run on! Could I check it out?
20:54:51 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aJotraeline Greatforge§f: §r§fQuite fascinating technology you have there, I'm sure with this machinery we could create even better appliances in the future!
20:55:03 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fEating enough of these surely should bring back my taste memories. Thank you.
