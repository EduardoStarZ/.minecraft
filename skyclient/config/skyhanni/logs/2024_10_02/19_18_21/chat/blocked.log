20:36:35 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Tammy§f: §r§fI've been planning to build a trap for unaware animals so I can hunt them more efficiently. I really need some cactus, preferably the ones with the biggest spikes!
20:36:38 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §rYou seem new here. You should probably try to get some §aEnchanted Baked Potato §ffor me.

20:36:49 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI don't really have a sweet tooth, but chocolate is probably my favorite thing in this world. But the supply is really poor mostly because of the mines' lack of accessibility.
20:37:32 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Tammy§f: §r§fAmazing! Thanks for taking the time! Now, time to finish my Cactus Trap...and hopefully it boosts my pelt earnings.
