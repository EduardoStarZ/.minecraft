17:55:16 §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fI have a big problem. I lost my sense of taste, now I can't tell the difference between a melon and a cactus...
17:55:18 §e[NPC] §aVex§f: §r§fI have an offer for you that you can't refuse.
17:55:20 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fThe amount of plots you can unlock here is perfect for a Co-op. So much space!
17:55:22 §e[NPC] §9Queen Mismyla§f: §r§fThe King made me go grocery shopping. Me! Can you believe that? He has a pair of perfectly good legs, and still, here I am.
18:13:09 §e[NPC] §aGimley§f: §r§fBuRRrP Burp!
18:13:10 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fGood choice!

18:13:18 §e[NPC] §9Seymour§f: §r§fWanting to buy something from me? I got some pretty fancy tuxedos for sale, for a price of a small fortune.
18:13:34 §e[NPC] §9Seymour§f: §r§fWow, don't you look dashing with that! Pleasure doing business with you.
18:13:54 §e[NPC] §9Queen Mismyla§f: §r§fI bet when I am back, they are all still sitting around that table! All day, every day! It's ludicrous!
18:40:45 §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fI have a big problem. I lost my sense of taste, now I can't tell the difference between a melon and a cactus...
18:40:47 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §rYou seem new here. You should probably try to get some §9Enchanted Melon Block §ffor me.
18:40:51 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §r§fSee ya next time!
19:48:18 §e[NPC] §9Tia the Fairy§f: §rYou are currently missing §d6 §fFairy Souls. Better get to work!
19:48:24 §e[NPC] §aJamie§f: §r§fYou might have noticed that you can purchase additional plots within your Desk in the Barn!
19:48:40 §e[NPC] §9Tia the Fairy§f: §rThat's exactly what I needed!
19:48:40 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fThe amount of plots you can unlock here is perfect for a Co-op. So much space!
19:48:42 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fGood choice!
19:48:44 §e[NPC] §aJotraeline Greatforge§f: §r§fI heard you have a composter in your barn, it happens to run on the same fuel drills run on! Could I check it out?
19:48:47 §e[NPC] §aJotraeline Greatforge§f: §r§fQuite fascinating technology you have there, I'm sure with this machinery we could create even better appliances in the future!
21:24:42 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fMy assistant is feeling off, and I think we could do with a hearty meal. Do you think you can help us out?
21:24:46 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fThank you! I'm sure this will make him feel better.
21:24:47 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI don't really have a sweet tooth, but chocolate is probably my favorite thing in this world. But the supply is really poor mostly because of the mines' lack of accessibility.
21:24:50 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §rYou seem new here. You should probably try to get some §aEnchanted Pumpkin §ffor me.
21:24:53 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §r§fSee ya next time!
21:24:54 §e[NPC] §aJamie§f: §r§fYou might have noticed that you can purchase additional plots within your Desk in the Barn!
