Original idea came from TBlazeWarriorT's Vanilla+ resource pack.
Originally only slightly modified but turned into a new resource pack with only a handful of textures kept from the original.

This is a WIP!

All Textures made by rainbowcraft*
*Might be a few textures leftover from Vanilla+. I am phasing those out as I work on the pack.
*Some textures are vanilla JAPPA textures from versions past 1.8.9, because it's easier and fits well.
